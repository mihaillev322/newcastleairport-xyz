<h2>Planning Your Journey from Newcastle Airport</h2>
<p>Newcastle International Airport serves over 5 million passengers annually, making it the primary gateway for travelers in Northeast England. Located just 6 miles northwest of Newcastle city center, the airport connects passengers to more than 80 destinations across Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. The single-terminal facility underwent a £20 million expansion in 2018, adding 1,000 square meters of retail space and improved security processing that now handles up to 3,000 passengers per hour during peak periods.</p>
<p>Finding holidays from Newcastle Airport has become significantly easier since 2019, when major tour operators expanded their seasonal offerings. TUI now operates 15 weekly flights to Mediterranean destinations during summer months, while Jet2holidays increased capacity by 23% in 2022. Package deals departing from Newcastle typically cost £150-300 less per person compared to connecting through London Heathrow, saving families substantial amounts on vacation budgets. The airport's partnership with regional travel agencies means you can often find exclusive deals on Newcastle airport hotel and parking bundles that aren't available through national booking platforms.</p>

Public transport options include the Metro system, which connects directly to the airport terminal with trains running every 12 minutes during peak hours and taking 23 minutes from Newcastle Central Station. The service costs £3.90 for a single adult ticket as of 2023, making it one of the most economical airport connections in the UK. National Express and local bus services also provide connections from Sunderland, Middlesbrough, and Durham, with fares ranging from £5.50 to £12.00 depending on distance.</p>
